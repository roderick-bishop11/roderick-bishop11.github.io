          Hello! My name is <a>Roderick Bishop</a>, a Junior <a> CS Major </a> also pursuing a minor in Robotics and Embodied Intelligence at <a>South Carolina State University.</a> On the outside, I am seen as a <a>leader</a> to the SCSU National Society of Black Engineers and Golden Key International Honour Society chapters, a <a>technology and coding enthusiast to my peers, a teacher to students</a>, and a <a>distinguished student in the SCSU Honors College</a>.
        </p>
        <p class = "about-text">
          While I am all of those things, I am also a person of great curiosity and <a>strong believer in growth and development and helping others</a>. I have always been someone who seeks to extend past the boundaries of my educational degree and foray into unknown territory. Because of that, I have been able to develop a <a>strong set of technical, leadership, and soft skills</a> that I believe would prove to be an asset in any industry.
        </p>
        <p class = "about-text">

          Lastly, I am also someone who<a> holds it votive to lend a helping hand to others.</a> <a>My caring heart is a big motivator for me</a> and is why my career interests will always begin and end with others in mind, no matter the industry. In the future, I would love to apply my skills within the <a>automotive, transportation, healthcare, and financial industries as well as public and non-profit sectors.</a>
